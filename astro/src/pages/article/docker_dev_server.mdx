## Introduction

Around March 2021, during the time of writing my bachelor thesis, I was looking for a cheap and quick way to host my
[3DMultilayer project page](../project/3dmultilayer). The project was just some static HTML and JS files, but it required
a valid SSL certificate to be able to use the WebXR API.

So I got myself the cheapest self-managed linux server from Hetzner. Installed Ubuntu server, docker, copied-pasted some
shell scripts to get an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. Then I just copied the static files to the server mapped it
to a basic nginx container in the '/var/www/html' folder and was done.

However, changing anything on the website was a pain. In addition, it was super unstable as it was not configured to
autostart the docker containers on reboot. So I had to manually start the containers every time the server was rebooted.

## Switch to Portainer

After a while I decided to upgrade to a more stable solution. My goals were:
* easily deploy new versions of the website
* have a stable server that automatically restarts after a reboot
* run other docker services octoprint, nextcloud, ... (basically a private cloud)
* have the ssl certificates automatically managed

The base system is the same. Just some Ubuntu server with docker (and docker-compose) installed.
I started by installing [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/). Portainer is a docker management tool that allows you
to easily manage one (or more) docker hosts. It has a nice web interface and allows you to easily deploy new stacks.
