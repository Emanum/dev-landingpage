  The motivation for this project was to enable visualization of hierarchical multi-layer datasets in a VR environment. We believe, that this can improve the visual clutter for large node-links graphs.

To achieve the proclaimed goals our application focuses on these features:

* Automatic creation of a force based node layout at runtime.
* Hierarchical nested layout with transparent nodes.
* Two Navigation Methods:
  * Free flying
   * Animated teleport
* Intuitive filtering of the displayed links by a virtual laser pointer.
* Adaptable flying speed and scale of the virtual scene
