## What is Port-Crane?

Port-Crane is a tool for providing a conainerized application to users. For now it is designed to be used with Docker and Kubernetes. There is a Dashboard where users can see the available applications and start/delete an instance of an application.

The project is still in a very early stage and is not ready for production use.
It is currently used as a demo project by me to learn more about running a Kubernetes cluster and to learn more about the Ktor framework.

The project is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Emanum/port-crane).
