## What is Portrait?
Portrait is a low-code platform for building flexible and dynamic web applications to display, search, filter, and even
modify existing datasets – all in one place!

The basic idea is providing a framework that allows users to create their own web applications via
a graphical user interface and some YAML configuration files.
We provide a set of customizable components (list, graph or map views or forms) and connectors to different
data sources, like SQL databases or the ECM system ELO.
In addition, we allow more advanced users to directly access the data via a REST API. In addition, we provide a python
runtime environment to allow users to write run custom python code including custom dependencies.

The target audience are mostly users with domain specific knowledge who are not familiar with programming but have a
basic understanding of technical concepts, like JSON or YAML. However, by providing a REST API and a python runtime
more advanced users can also use Portrait to build their own applications.

More information can be found on the [official website](https://portrait.app/) and in [docs](https://docs.portrait.app/).

## Contribution

Portrait is my main project during my employment at Treskon GmbH. I am responsible for the development of the backend and
infrastructure.

The project consists of multiple docker containers that are orchestrated by docker-compose for easy deployment and low
requirements for the IT infrastructure. The components are:

* The backend is written in Java using the Spring framework.
* As main datastore we use elasticsearch instance.
* The frontend is written in React.
* A python runtime environment is used to execute custom python code.
* Nginx is used as a reverse proxy.
